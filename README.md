# Plug'n Play
This project is a collection of starter templates and component libraries for various frontend web development frameworks.

## What we have here
Currently the project only has a [`Next.js starter`](/next-starter/) filled with useful components I've built over the past year of using the framework that I've had to copy and paste across several projects. These components range from simple buttons to complex app features complete with their own micro-interactive animations.

## Getting started
You'll need the latest LTS version of NodeJs to get started.

### <u>If you want all the templates</u>
First clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:orunto/plug_n_play.git

# After cloning is complete navigate to your preferred starter
cd preffered-starter

npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
<br/>

### <u>Or you just want a specific starter</u>
#### Next.js
```bash
# npm
npx create-next-app [project-name] -e https://github.com/orunto/plug_n_play/next-starter-app

npx create-next-app [project-name] -e https://github.com/orunto/plug_n_play/next-starter-pages

# pnpm
pnpm create next-app [project-name] -e https://github.com/orunto/plug_n_play/next-starter-app

pnpm create next-app [project-name] -e https://github.com/orunto/plug_n_play/next-starter-pages

```

## Contributing
If you have a couple of components you think would help other devs get started with their projects or you have an entire starter template you'd like to share, lemme know [here](https://github.com/orunto/plug_n_play/discussions/categories/ideas)

Contributions are not limited to Next.js or other frontend web development.
